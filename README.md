## Objective
This project was implemented in order to apply and practice `React-Native` concepts.

Although the project idea was inspired in a video from *Rocketseat*, the entire implementation was done independently.

## Main Technologies and Tools
Besides `React-Native`, this project uses the following technologies in its implementation:
- **Redux** & **Redux-Persist**: used to store and persist data
- **Redux-Thunk**: applies middlewares in some action creators in order to deal with asynchronous code

## Tests
Some automated tests for components were implemented using **Jest** and **Enzyme**
